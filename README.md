dotfiles
========

A simple repo for my dotfiles. I'll leave it up to you to figure out where everything goes.

Use 'git clone git@github.com:ppeble/dotfiles.git' to pull down everything.

## Versions:

* `tmux`: `tmux 3.0a`
* `zsh`: `zsh 5.3 (x86_64-apple-darwin18.0)`
* `nvim`: `v0.11.0`

## Notes

* This is base nvim, nothing special
* This is base tmux, nothing special
* This is macos zsh, nothing special
