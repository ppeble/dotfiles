dotfiles
========

A repo for my dotfiles.

## Versions:

* `tmux`: `tmux 3.5a`
* `zsh`: `zsh 5.9`
* `nvim`: `v0.11.0`

## Notes

* This is base nvim, nothing special
* This is base tmux, nothing special
* This is macos zsh, nothing special

## nvim

Install nvim, then:

* copy .vimrc to `~/.vimrc`
* copy the `nvim` dir to `~/.config/nvim`. This should be enough to get lazyvim loaded and installing what it needs when it starts

I don't use pathogen or vim-plug anymore so the `.vim` directory is probably not necessary for anything and just kept for history.

## tmux

Copy `.tmux.conf` to `~/.tmux.conf`
